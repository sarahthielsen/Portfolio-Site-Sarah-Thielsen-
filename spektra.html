          <h1>Spektra Financial</h1>
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <p>
            I began working on Spektra as a student with CareerFoundry. The
            project brief was for an app called Pluto Pay - a web app that
            allows anyone to shop, transfer money, and more without a debit or
            credit card or the need to visit a physical bank or store. My role
            was to create a new app design from beginning to end. I was
            responsible for all UX duties, including user research, producing
            all significant deliverables, and providing a consistent exposition
            of my design process. I decided to take this project a step further
            and focus specifically on designing an app for young adults with
            ADHD who struggle with their personal finances.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A busy interface that contains too much information and overwhelms users
                </li>
                <li>Lack of incentives that allow users to avoid checking the app</li>
                <li>The organization of the app is too rigid for individuals to set themselves up for success</li>

            <h4>Initial Hypothesis</h4>
          <p>
            Spektras users with ADHD need an intuitive, organized, and personalized way to take control of their finances, 
            improve their money management skills, and feel more confident in their financial decision-making. 
            We will know this to be true when we observe a significant increase in the number of users who are able to successfully reach their financial goals with our app.

          <h5>Phase 1: Inspiration</h5>
          <h2>Discovery &* Research</h2>
          <p>
            Before I could even being thinking about what Spektra might look like or it exact features, 
            I needed to conduct some research. First with competitive analysis and content audits of related apps, 
            followed by user research in the form of surveys and interviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This process took roughly 3 weeks</span>

          <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
          <p>
            To set the stage for this project, I started off by conducting a competitive analysis 
            of some relevant and related apps in Canada. KOHO is the closest comparison to Spektra as they 
            focus on a similar target demographic, and tries to help users with spending and saving habits. 
            Their weaknesses and opportunities helped me the most to understand where Spektra might be able to 
            fit into the market.

          <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
          <h4>User Survey</h4>
          <p>
            The first round of user research was a short survey conducted remotely through google forms.
            8 participants completed the survey comprising 16 questions with a mix of multiple-choice, short-answer, 
            and rating scale responses. Using this survey, I hoped to begin gaining insights into how people generally 
            feel about their finances.

          <p>
            The responses collected from this survey were foundational to my understanding of my future users pain points. 
            Particularly helpful was the question asking participants to select which struggles they face with their personal finances.
            Of the 8 possible choices, participants indicated that their greatest conserns centred around monthy payments, emergency funds,
            future investments, and unnecesary spending. The trends that occurred in that question would be very beneficial to me when deciding 
            which features were the most important to focus on first with the new app. 
            Additionally, I wanted to see how the individuals who identified as being neurodivergent answered the questions as 
            compared to those who didn't.            
            I also thought it was interesting to note how participants feel generally worried about their finances, 
            <span class="highlightme">yet most are very optimistic about improving them!</span>

          <h3>USER INTERVIEWS</h3>
          <p>
            The responses gathered from the user survey helped me to curate 13 open-ended questions to allow me 
            to gain more insight in user interviews. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I conducted 4 in-person user interviews over the course of 
            a week. Participants were invited to join me for a coffee or light meal as I guided them through the 
            interview questions.
          </p> 
          <p>
            The questions were intended to help me understand these participantsâ€™ needs, goals, and timeframes 
            around their finances as well as their background and attitudes towards current apps in the market.
