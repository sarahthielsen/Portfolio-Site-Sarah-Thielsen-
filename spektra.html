              <h2>My Role</h2>
              <p>
                I began working on Spektra as a student with CareerFoundry. The
                project brief was for an app called Pluto Pay - a web app that
                allows anyone to shop, transfer money, and more without a debit
                or credit card or the need to visit a physical bank or store. My
                role was to create a new app design from beginning to end. I was
                responsible for all UX duties, including user research,
                producing all significant deliverables, and providing a
                consistent exposition of my design process. I decided to take
                this project a step further and focus specifically on designing
                an app for young adults with ADHD who struggle with their
                personal finances.

              <h4>Initial Hypothesis</h4>
              <p>
                Spektras users with ADHD need an intuitive, organized, and
                personalized way to take control of their finances, improve
                their money management skills, and feel more confident in their
                financial decision-making. We will know this to be true when we
                observe a significant increase in the number of users who are
                able to successfully reach their financial goals with our app.

            <p>
              Before I could even being thinking about what Spektra might look
              like or it exact features, I needed to conduct some research.
              First with competitive analysis and content audits of related
              apps, followed by user research in the form of surveys and
              interviews.

            <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <p>
              To set the stage for this project, I started off by conducting a
              competitive analysis of some relevant and related apps in Canada.
              KOHO is the closest comparison to Spektra as they focus on a
              similar target demographic, and tries to help users with spending
              and saving habits. Their weaknesses and opportunities helped me
              the most to understand where Spektra might be able to fit into the
              market.

            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <h4>User Survey</h4>
            <p>
              The first round of user research was a short survey conducted
              remotely through google forms. 8 participants completed the survey
              comprising 16 questions with a mix of multiple-choice,
              short-answer, and rating scale responses. Using this survey, I
              hoped to begin gaining insights into how people generally feel
              about their finances.
            </p>

              />
              <img

              />
            </picture>
            <p>
              The responses collected from this survey were foundational to my
              understanding of my future users pain points. Particularly helpful
              was the question asking participants to select which struggles
              they face with their personal finances. Of the 8 possible choices,
              participants indicated that their greatest conserns centred around
              monthy payments, emergency funds, future investments, and
              unnecesary spending. The trends that occurred in that question
              would be very beneficial to me when deciding which features were
              the most important to focus on first with the new app.
              Additionally, I wanted to see how the individuals who identified
              as being neurodivergent answered the questions as compared to
              those who didn't. I also thought it was interesting to note how
              participants feel generally worried about their finances,

                <h3>USER INTERVIEWS</h3>
                <p>
                  The responses gathered from the user survey helped me to
                  curate 13 open-ended questions to allow me to gain more
                  insight in user interviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I conducted 4 in-person user interviews over the course of a
                  week. Participants were invited to join me for a coffee or
                  light meal as I guided them through the interview questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The questions were intended to help me understand these
                  participants’ needs, goals, and timeframes around their
                  finances as well as their background and attitudes towards
                  current apps in the market.

            <h3>RESEARCH SYNTHESIS</h3>
            <p>
              The amount of feedback I received from conducting user research
              was abundant! Lots of the responses confirmed my hypothesis but
              also challenged it. In order to distill specific insights from
              this information, I decided to create four affinity maps of all of
              the responses from my user interviews. These affinity maps are;
              behaviours &* attitudes, needs &* goals, frustrations, and quotes
              &* facts. These insights have challenged my own beliefs about what
              is best for users, and have also been extremely helpful for me to
              move on to the next steps of my design process.

                  Although I initially intended to concentrate specifically on
                  young adults with ADHD, I soon realized that young adults in
                  general—neurodivergent or not— are having trouble focusing and
                  finishing crucial tasks as they are faced with constant
                  distractions on their devices.

                <h4>UPDATED HYPOTHESIS</h4>
                <p>
                  Spektra's young adult users need an intuitive, organized, and
                  personalized way to take control of their finances, improve
                  their money management skills, and feel more confident in
                  their financial decision-making. The app must minimize
                  interruptions and promote focus to enable users to make
                  progress toward their financial goals
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will know this to be true when we observe a significant
                  increase in the number of users who are able to successfully
                  reach their financial goals with our app.

            <h2>POV <amp>&</amp> IDEATION</h2>
            <p>
              Based on the updated hypothesis and the data collected, the next
              step is to start designing the interface of spektra. This process
              involved using the information gathered to create an interface
              that is user-friendly and meets the needs of the target audience.
              With careful consideration of the user experience, the interface
              should be intuitive, visually appealing, and efficient.

            <h3>WHO AM I DESIGNING FOR?</h3>
            <p>
              Through my research, I identified two distinct user groups and
              decided to create personas to help me design Spektra's interface
              to better meet their needs.
              <span style="font-weight: 600"
                >Sophia was chosen as the primary persona</span
              >
              since she represents the largest segment of our target audience -
              <span
                style="text-decoration: underline solid rgb(237, 174, 0) 2px"
              >
                young adults with ADHD who are working towards better money
                management.</span
              >
              Isabelle, the secondary persona, represents a precursing
              demographic of students with very tight incomes who want to learn
              how to save. By understanding their financial goals, pain points,
              and behavioral patterns, we can create an interface that is
              tailored to their needs.

            <h4>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h4>
            <p>
              After creating personas for Spektra's users, I moved on to
              ideating a site map for the app's interface. The site map is
              essentially a visual representation of the app's information
              architecture and hierarchy, providing a clear overview of its
              navigation and content structure. To create the site map, I needed
              to consider the main features, pages, and interactions that users
              will encounter while using the app, and ensure that the site map
              reflects the needs and preferences of both personas. It was
              important to keep the information architecture intuitive and
              user-friendly so that users can easily find what they need and
              navigate the app without any confusion. Overall, by creating a
              detailed site map, I was able to better visualize the app's
              structure and content, and use it as a guide as I began drawing up
              the first wireframes.

                <h3>RAPID PROTOTYPING</h3>
                <p>
                  Finally, after several rounds of user research, ideation,
                  dwelling, twiddling my thumbs, staring thoughtfully out my
                  window, and pondering, I was ready to begin drawing the very
                  first wireframes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I began by sketching out about 50 super ugly wireframes,
                  playing with the layout and the hierarchy of information. I
                  wanted to focus these rapid prototyping sessions on three main
                  features that I believe will be the most beneficial for our
                  users;
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Buckets (now 'Wallets')</li>
                  <li>Round-ups</li>
                  <li>Budget Tracker (now 'Insights')</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These example prototypes are the first flows for setting up
                  the round-ups feature. This user flow has probably changed the
                  least throughout all of the iterations. I loved building this
                  feature however because it helped me remember that not every
                  flow needs to be a whole process, round-ups set up is short
                  and sweet :)

                  I conducted six usability tests on the new Spektra prototype
                  from August 21-26th. Three tests were conducted in person and
                  three were conducted online through google meet. Participants
                  were asked to share some background information about
                  themselves and then they were asked to complete four tasks
                  using the prototype. Usability Test Plan

                  as well as the positive feedback on the interface. These data
                  visualizations included an affinity map and a rainbow
                  spreadsheet. For the sake of brevity, I have only included
                  some key takeaways in this case study.

              To set the stage for this project, I started off by conducting a
              competitive analysis of some relevant and related apps in Canada.
              KOHO is the closest comparison to Spektra as they focus on a
              similar target demographic, and tries to help users with spending
              and saving habits. Their weaknesses and opportunities helped me
              the most to understand where Spektra might be able to fit into the
              market.

                  The design of the home screen has posed a significant
                  challenge as I strive to display all essential information in
                  a clear and accessible manner. With each iteration, I have
                  built upon the previous version, experimenting with new ways
                  to draw the user's attention to the most important content.
                  Notable examples include a complete layout overhaul from
                  mid-fidelity to hi-fi #1, and the modification of the CTA card
                  color and hierarchy from hi-fi #2 to our current iteration.

                <h4>INNOVATIVE FLOWS</h4>
                <p>
                  When I first tested the wallets feature with users, they found
                  it confusing, frustrating, and boring. Many people also said
                  they didn't want to put money into their wallets right away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In an attempt to mediate these issues, I broke down the form
                  field into two steps.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Naming the wallet and category (mandatory)</li>
                  <li>Setting goals and dates (skippable)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Users are not prompted to add funds to their wallet until they
                  have created it. This allows for more flexibility and
                  personalization, with fewer steps in the initial setup.

            <h3>ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES</h3>
            <p>
              Before I could launch the final product it was important that I
              take steps to ensure that my design met accessibility standards.
              In order to do this, I enlisted the help of 5 other UX design
              students as well as some friends and family to test out the latest
              version of the Spektra prototype. The feedback from my
              CareerFoundry peers was especially helpful and helped me update my
              design to be as inclusive as possible. I have included some of the
              more significant changes below along with my solutions/
              reasonings.

          <h3>I WAS CHALLENGED...</h3>
          <p>
            Being that this was the first project that I had run from beginning
            to end, I had countless challenges throughout the process. I
            remember a diagram I saw at the begining of this project that
            depicted "the process of UX design". At the time the silliness of
            the diagram made me chuckle, but now at the end of this project, I
            can say I completely understand the truth behind it!
          </p>

          </picture>
          <h3>BUT I LEARNED A LOT!</h3>
          <p>
            I would say at least 85% of the project felt like a big scribbled
            mess of information and new skills and I had no idea how I was going
            to bring it all together. However, as I became more confident in my
            skills, and my knowledge of UX grew, I finally began to see the light
            at the end of the tunnel. This project has been the best lesson of
            "trust the process" that I've ever had. In the future, I know that I
            will be ready to embrace the chaos with the confidence that it will
            all work out in the end.
